# MagicalPdfEditor
This is a small PDF editor based on [OpenPDF Core](https://github.com/HamidrezaAmz/OpenPDF) and [AndroidPdfViewer](https://github.com/HamidrezaAmz/MagicalPdfViewer).
As there is not much open source easy working PDF editors and PDF wizards, I decied to create a simple directory to resolve my issues. Here I have worked on two seprate cores, add some functionality into them and combining them together to acheive my target. I am working on this repo, any help will be appreciated.
