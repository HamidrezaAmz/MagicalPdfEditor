# Interfaces
Here is the list of interfaces that can help you work with this lib.

| Interface | Description |
| --- | --- |
| OnPageErrorListener | Triggered when sth went wrong on loading the pdf file |
| OnLoadCompleteListener | Triggered when loading pdf file finished |
| OnPageChangeListener | Triggered when page status changed, this will give you page count an new page index |

# Attention
Working with files is **restricted** in higher android api levels, So if you are working with high level android APIs, be aware of using file provides and needed permissions to work with files, Or you can use [SimpleStorage](https://github.com/anggrayudi/SimpleStorage) lib to work with files and Android storage.
